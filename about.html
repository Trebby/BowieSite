    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      David Bowie was born in South London's Brixton neighborhood on January 8, 1947.<br>
      His first hit was the song "Space Oddity" in 1969.
      <br><br>The original pop chameleon, Bowie became a fantastical sci-fi character for his breakout Ziggy Stardust album. He later co-wrote "Fame" with Carlos Alomar and John Lennon, which became his first American No. 1 single in 1975. An accomplished actor, Bowie starred in The Man Who Fell to Earth in 1976.
      <br><br>He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Shortly after releasing his final album, Bowie died from cancer on January 10, 2016.
